# Learning PyGObject

Alright, so from the looks of it, PyGObject isn't all that complicated. There are _five_ main steps to learning:
1. The Getting Started Code
2. The Basics Tab
3. How to Deal With Strings
4. The Widget Gallary
5. Layouts

## Getting Started
The getting started code seems to be two code examples:
1. Writing a basic example to create a window object
2. Creating a window subclass, with my own widgets and layouts. Specifically a simple button on an empty window.
The getting started code gives a good overview of the structure of a GTK app using PyGObject

## Basics
Basics is kinda wack. Two sections _Main Loop_ and _Properties_ Mostly just explaining some stuff

## How to Deal With Strings
Same as "basics." Feels oddly specific, but it's up at the start, so I guess I'll read through it.

## The Widget Gallary
Alright, this is where the real sauce is. Everything GTK has to offer. Play around here a bit to get aqquainted with the various that are available.

## Layout Containers
Arguably the most important part I guess. Look at this after playing around with like two or three widgets and gain a solid understanding of the way things are layed out.

## Step VI!
After this I have learned the basics of this module. Play around with more widgets, but I think I'm ready for some projects :))
